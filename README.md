# CHCAA's Introduction to Python #

## Technicalities

### Cloud Service
[UCloud](https://cloud.sdu.dk/app/login/)

### CHCAA Server
[Worker-2-Jupyter](https://worker02.chcaa.au.dk/jupyter/hub/login)

### Local installation
If and only if you prefer to have your tools running locally (on your own machine), you should make sure to have Python 3.6+, git, a Unix terminal emulator, and Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab) installed. On Windows 10 machines, we suggest 'Ubuntu on Windows' (from the app store), which allows you to use Ubuntu Terminal and run Ubuntu command line utilities including bash and git. For Mac, you need to install Python 3.6+ and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). If Linux, well you're probably good.

Swiss army knife solution irrespective of OS: install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual-d)

!!!Disclaimer: We take no responsibility for your local installation.!!!
